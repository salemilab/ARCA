<P>The ARCA database allows users to select the arbovirus, geographical
region, country, and/or time range of their choice within a single
output. To select multiple arboviruses, regions, or countries, users
can either hold down the control (ctrl) button to select multiple
options (Windows) or hold down the command button to select multiple
options (Mac). When selecting a particular time range, users can
specify their query by inputting the weeks and years of interest. When
users submit their query, a table will be generated with 6 columns for
virus, geographical region, country, year, week, and the reported
cases for that week. Users can also plot their query to visualize the
case reported data they are interested in.</P>
